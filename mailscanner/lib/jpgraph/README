Requirements:
-------------
Miminum:
* PHP 4.1 or higher
* GD 1.8.x or higher

Recommended:
* PHP 4.3.1 
* GD 2.11 or higher
Or:
* PHP 4.3.1 with budled GD library. 
  (Note: 4.3.1 has a minor bug in GD which causes text at an
  angle to be a few pixels off its correct position.)

Installation
------------
0. Make sure your PHP is at least 4.1 (preferrable 4.3.1) 
   and that you have compiled support for GD library. 
   You must make aboslutely sure that you have GD working. 
   Please run phpinfo() to check if GD library
   is supported in your installation.
   
1. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice.

2. Verify that the default paths for Font and Cache directory
   suits your installation. 

3. Verify that the runtime parameters for the library at 
   top of jpgraph.php is setup to your preference. 
   The default values should suit most users. 
   
4. Make sure that the process running PHP have write privileges 
   to your cache directory if you have enabled the cache.
   The cache is disabled by default.

5. Read (really!) the FAQ on http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpg_faq.php.


A final note on GD library.
---------------------------
If you are using an older version of GD 2.x (2.07 or lower) you 
_really_ need to upgrade. 


Troubleshooting
---------------
1. Any PHP errors about function "imagecreate" does not exist indicates that
   your PHP installation does not include the GD library. This must be present.

2. Any error about "parent::" undefined means that you are not using PHP 4.1 or
   above. 
   This problem has also
   been reported by people running Zend-cache and is a bug in Zend. A
   workaround is to move all files into one single file.

3. If you don't get any background images (but rather a solid black
   box) you are using GD 2.x but have disabled truecolor
   support. Correct this by enabling the USE_TRUECOLOR define.

4. If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find
   font' when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change you paths
   to UNIX style, i.e. "/usr/local/fonts/ttf/". Remember that the
   path is absolute and not relative to the htdocs catalogue.

5. If you are using the cache please make sure that you have
   set the permissions correctly for the cache directory so that
   Apache/PHP can write to that directory.


Known problem
-------------
1. A bug in GD 2.08 makes text at an angle != 0 to be a few pixels
   if the expected position.
