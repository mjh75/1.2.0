Change in the handling of TTF fonts
===================================

From version 1.9p the handling of TTF fonts have changed. 

There is no more a separate font package to JpGraph. Instead
the library will now assume the exact same TTF file name
as is standard with the TTF core font files as distributed 
by Microsoft TM.

Some font file names have changed and this means that if
you have existing scripts that make use of TTF fonts
you may now get a "Can't find font error".

You should therefore install the Standard MS Core-WEB fonts
as described below.


Actions:
---------

On a Windows system:
--------------------
Set the font path in JpGraph to the standard Windows font library,
e.g.

DEFINE('TTF_DIR','C:/WINDOWS/FONTS/');


On a Unix system
----------------
Download and install the MS Core Web-fonts from
 
   http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/
